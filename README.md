# Alternate Reality Lawson Kiosk

Hi there. This is a fun art project which replaced the kiosk (perhaps without consent) in Purdue's Lawson Commons the week before finals. It includes a multiplayer variant of minesweeper and Wikipedia racing (there are two kiosks so players can face off across from each other), all written from scratch in C++ and Typescript.

I've stripped a bunch of probably copyrighted fonts from this repository and cleared its commit history. Otherwise, it is mostly intact.
